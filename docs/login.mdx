		<AlertDropDown title={'If it takes too long'} severity="warning" defaultOpen={true}>
      If it takes &gt;3 minutes, refresh the page once. If it still doesn‚Äôt start, try a different image. Please note, servers may take longer to start during peak usage times. BadgerCompute is a shared resource and availability is not guaranteed.
    </AlertDropDown>

9. **You‚Äôre in!** Start working in JupyterLab.
    
    You can create notebooks, open terminals, and manage files. 
    
    ![Image title](/docs/login-guide/jupyter-lab.png)


## After you log in

- **You‚Äôre in JupyterLab.** Use the Launcher to open notebooks (`.ipynb`), terminals, or text editors. See our [Welcome to BadgerCompute](hello-jupyter) page for an example 
data analysis! 
- **Your files live in your home directory.** Anything under your home persists across restarts unless otherwise noted by your site‚Äôs storage policy.
- **To end your session:** _File ‚Üí Log Out_ (JupyterLab) and optionally **Stop My Server** on the Hub page to free resources.

<Alert severity="info" sx={{ my: 2 }}>
  <AlertTitle>Come back later</AlertTitle>
  Bookmark the link <a href="https://launch.badgercompute.wisc.edu">launch.badgercompute.wisc.edu</a>. When you return, you‚Äôll usually go straight in via SSO unless your session expired (you‚Äôll be prompted to sign in again). Your notebook may be stopped if idle, but files in your <code>/work</code> directory persist for 30 days.
</Alert>

## Troubleshooting

<AlertDropDown title={<>I get a <strong>Not Authorized</strong> page</>} severity="info">
	Your account may not be provisioned yet. You must complete the Canvas course and pass all checks before your account can be created. Accounts may take upto 24hrs to be activated. If you believe this is in error, contact support (see below).
</AlertDropDown>

<AlertDropDown title={<>Stuck on <strong>Server Starting</strong></>} severity="info">
	Refresh the page once. If it persists for >2‚Äì3 minutes:
	1) Click **Stop My Server**,
	2) Click **Start My Server** again,
	3) If it still fails, try a different server size or image and contact support with the approximate time and chosen options.

	**Note: Servers may take longer to start during peak usage times. BadgerCompute is a shared resource and availability is not guaranteed.**
</AlertDropDown>

<AlertDropDown title={'I am getting a "400 : Bad Request" error'} severity="info">
	This can happen if you already have an active session and try to start a new one. You can return to your previous session or stop it from the [Hub page](https://badgerhub.jupyter-uw-prod.chtc.io/hub/home). If the issue persists, try logging out and back in, or clear your cookies.
</AlertDropDown>

## Sign-out, timeouts, and idle culling

- **Sign-out:** From JupyterLab, use _File ‚Üí Log Out_. On the Hub page, you can also **Stop My Server**.
- **Timeouts:** To keep capacity available, servers **will** be shut down automatically after a period of 4hrs since the start of the session. Files in your /work directory persist for 30 days. All other data may be deleted upon server shutdown.
- **Session expiration:** Your SSO session will periodically require re-authentication (especially after closing the browser or long idle periods).


## Privacy & data notes

- **Authentication:** You will authenticate via UW-Madison SSO (NetID). Refer to [UW-Madison's Privacy Notice](https://www.wisc.edu/privacy-notice/) for details on how your data is handled.
- **Files:** Stored in your BadgerCompute home or attached volumes according to the [BadgerCompute policy](/policies#data-retention-policy).
- **Compute usage tracking:** We track aggregate usage metrics to improve the service and plan capacity.
