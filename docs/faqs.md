1. **I'm a teacher - can I use BadgerCompute for a demonstration?**

    You are welcome to use BadgerCompute for demonstration purposes.

    Keep in mind, however, that the service operates on a first-come, first-served basis, and that there is limited capacity.
    *We cannot guarantee that you will have access to BadgerCompute when you need it during class.*

1. **I'm a teacher of a small course (< 10 students) - can I tell my students to use BadgerCompute for coursework?**

    Using BadgerCompute in a small course (< 10 students) should be okay.

    That being said, since this is a new service with limited capacity, we recommend that
    you share alternative ways to complete coursework besides using BadgerCompute.
    We cannot guarantee that the service will be operational at all times.

1. **I'm a teacher of a large course (> 10 students) - can I tell my students to use BadgerCompute for coursework?**

    Due to the limited availability of the service at this time, *please do not tell your students to use BadgerCompute*.

    If you are interested in using BadgerCompute in a large course, feel free to connect with us via the [BadgerCompute Community Discourse]().
