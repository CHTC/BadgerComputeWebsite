1. **Who can use BadgerCompute?**

    There are only two requirements for using BadgerCompute:

    1. You must have an active [NetID](https://kb.wisc.edu/iam/page.php?id=4966).
    2. You must have completed the [Certification Course on Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/JR887K) for the current academic year, which includes agreeing to our [Acceptable Use Policy](https://badgercompute.wisc.edu/policies/).

1. **How many resources can I get? Can I use GPUs?**

	Resources available are described on our [policies page](https://badgercompute.wisc.edu/policies/#availability). These include CPUs, 
	memory and GPUs. 
	
	There may be times when users are not 
	able to start a session, depending on demand. 

1. **How many people can use BadgerCompute at once?**

    We can support approximately 80-100 concurrent users at this time.

1. **I'm a student - can I use BadgerCompute for my class?**

    You are welcome to use BadgerCompute for class work. However, we make no guarantees that the service will be available if you need it at a specific time; we are not responsible for missed deadlines based on BadgerCompute availability. 

1. **I'm a teacher - can I use BadgerCompute for a demonstration?**

    You are welcome to use BadgerCompute for demonstration purposes.

    Keep in mind, however, that the service operates on a first-come, first-served basis, and that there is limited capacity.
    *Currently, we cannot guarantee that you will have access to BadgerCompute when you need it during class.* 

1. **I'm a teacher of a course that includes computational work - can I tell my students to use BadgerCompute for coursework?**

    Using BadgerCompute in a small course (< 10 students) should be okay. Note that 
    this is a new service, with limited capacity, so we cannot guarantee that students
    will be able to access sessions whenever they need them (for example, the night 
    before a homework is due), so we do recommend you share alternative options to 
    Badger Compute as well. 
    
    For a larger class, get in touch ([Community Forum](https://community.badgercompute.wisc.edu/c/get-started/5)) and we can discuss whether BadgerCompute or 
    another service will be the best fit for your learners' needs.

## Using BadgerCompute notebooks

1. **Why can't I log in to the BadgerCompute notebook?**

    1. Have you completed (and passed!) the [Certification Course on Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu/enroll/JR887K)? 
    1. Have you waited at least 24 hours since passing the course? 
    
    If the answer to both of the questions is yes, and you still can't access the 
    BadgerCompute notebooks, contact us on the [Community Forum](https://community.badgercompute.wisc.edu/c/get-started/5). 

1. **Why is my notebook taking forever to start?**

    The BadgerCompute service may be at full capacity or undergoing maintenance.
    You can continue to wait, or try again later.

1. **How long will my BadgerCompute notebook session last?**

    The notebook session will automatically shut down after 4 hours, even if you are actively using it. There is a timer at the bottom of the window to show you how much 
    time you have left. 

    A notebook session is considered "inactive" if there are no browsers connected to the session. 
    After 10 minutes of inactivity, the session will automatically shut down.

1. **The notebook shutdown while I was using it. Will my work be saved?**
    
    On shutdown, any `.ipynb` files with unsaved changes will be automatically saved.
    Changes to any other files will be discarded.

    Only files in the `~/work` directory will persist between sessions. Any files outside
    this location will be deleted between sessions.
