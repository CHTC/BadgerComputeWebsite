# Guided Intro to Using BadgerCompute (UW–Madison JupyterHub)

Welcome! This short, hands-on intro will get you running on **BadgerCompute**, UW–Madison’s JupyterHub service. You’ll:

1) Launch JupyterLab using the **Basic Data Science** container  
2) Download (`wget`) a ready-made notebook and a small dataset  
3) Run a toy analysis in Python (pandas + matplotlib)  
4) Learn how to save, shut down, and log out

<br>

## Prerequisites

- A UW NetID and access to **BadgerCompute** (JupyterHub).
- A modern web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari).
- No local installs required—everything runs in the cloud.

<br>

## Log in and choose the Basic Data Science environment

1. Go to the BadgerCompute JupyterHub. <Link href={NOTEBOOK_URL}><Button variant={'outlined'} size="small" endIcon={<RocketLaunchIcon />}>Launch Notebook</Button></Link>
2. Log in with your UW credentials and accept the Terms if prompted.
3. On the **Server Option** page, choose the **Environment**:
   - **Environment:** `Basic Data Science (includes libraries from the Python, R, and Julia communities)`
4. Click **Start**. You’ll land in **JupyterLab**.

<Alert severity="warning" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
  <AlertTitle>This may take a few minutes</AlertTitle>
  Wait patiently while your server starts. If it takes more than 10 minutes, try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. Wait times may be longer during peak usage periods.
</Alert>

<br>

## Familiarize yourself with JupyterLab's Interface

- **File Browser** (left sidebar): navigate folders, upload/download files.
- **Launcher** (main area): create new Notebooks/Terminals/Text files.
- **Kernel**: the compute engine for your notebook (e.g., Python 3).
- **Tabs**: notebooks and terminals open as tabs across the top.

<Alert severity="info" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
  <AlertTitle>Notebook vs Console</AlertTitle>
  When you open a **Notebook**, it runs code in cells and shows outputs inline. A **Terminal** is a command-line interface for running shell commands. You can use either depending on your task. Notebooks are a great way to combine code, results, and narrative text for data analysis. You can write and execute code in cells, see outputs immediately, and document your workflow with Markdown.
</Alert>

<br>

## Create a workspace folder (optional but recommended)

Let’s keep this tidy:

1. In the **File Browser**, double-click on `/work` 
2. Right-click and choose **New Folder**.
3. Name it: `badgercompute_intro`
4. Double-click to enter that folder.

<Alert severity="info" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
  <AlertTitle>Persistent storage</AlertTitle>
  Your `/work` directory is the only top-level directory which offers persistent storage. Files kept here will remain available across sessions for up to 30 days after your last login. Files in other directories may be deleted when your server stops.
</Alert>

<br>

## Download a notebook + dataset with `wget`

We’ll pull:
- A small example **Jupyter notebook** (from a public repository)
- The **Palmer Penguins** dataset (CSV) for a quick analysis

You can do this either from a **Terminal** or **inside a notebook**.

### Option A: Use a Terminal
1. From the **Launcher**, click **Terminal** in the **Other** section of the Launcher.
2. Run:

```bash
# Move into your workspace folder (adjust if your folder name differs)
cd ~/work/badgercompute_intro

# Download a ready-made notebook (rename it locally for convenience)
wget -O getting_started.ipynb \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter/e5aece1011a43edfd739cbd83a2f4346091a86e2/notebooks/getting_started_with_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb

# Download the Palmer Penguins dataset (CSV)
wget -O penguins.csv \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv

# Verify files
ls -lh
```
### Option B: Use !wget inside a Notebook

In any Python notebook cell, you can prefix shell commands with !:

```python
import os

!wget -O getting_started.ipynb \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter/e5aece1011a43edfd739cbd83a2f4346091a86e2/notebooks/getting_started_with_jupyter_notebooks.ipynb

!wget -O penguins.csv \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv

!ls -lh
```

<Alert severity="info" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
	<AlertTitle>Note</AlertTitle>
	If you don&#39;t see the files, ensure you&#39;re in the correct folder. The current working directory for the Terminal is shown by `pwd`.
	Inside Python, try:
	```python
	import os
	print(os.getcwd())
	```
	You should also be able to see the files in the __File Browser__. If you don&#39;t, click the refresh icon on the __File Browser__.
</Alert>

## Open the downloaded notebook (optional exploration)

In the File Browser, double-click getting_started.ipynb.
Skim a few cells to see Markdown, code cells, and keyboard shortcuts. This notebook is a great resource to learn more about Jupyter notebooks and basic python. The notebook was created by the [Reproducible Science Curriculum](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/introduction-RR-Jupyter) team.

## Create your own toy notebook

Now let’s make a new notebook and do a tiny analysis in the BadgerCompute environment:

Go back to the **Launcher** (click the “+” icon at top left if needed).

Under **Notebook**, choose Python 3 (or similar).

Save it right away as `toy_penguins_analysis.ipynb` inside `badgercompute_intro/`.

	<AlertTitle>Saving</AlertTitle>
	You can also save with cmd+s (command+s on mac) or File → Save Notebook.
</Alert>

### Using Markdown in Your Notebook

You can add text cells using Markdown to explain your analysis. Here’s a quick example of Markdown syntax:

```markdown
# Meet the Penguins

For this toy tutorial, we will use the [Palmer Penguin dataset](). The dataset was collected by [Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station Antarctica Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/).

Artwork by @allison_horst
```

To convert a cell to Markdown, press `esc` then `m` or select `Code` on the Notebook menu and select `Markdown`. To edit the cell, double-click it. To render the Markdown, press `shift+enter`.

![Changing a Cell Type to Markdown](/docs/guided-intro-to-badgercompute/markdown-in-notebook.png)

### Import libraries and load data
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the CSV we downloaded
penguins = pd.read_csv("penguins.csv")
penguins.head()
```

### Inspect and clean

```python
# Quick shape and columns
penguins.shape, df.columns.tolist()
```

```python
# Basic info and missing values
penguins.info()
penguins.isna().sum()
```

```python
# Drop rows missing core numeric measurements to simplify this toy example
clean_penguins = df.dropna(subset=["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", "flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g"])
clean_penguins.shape
```
### Simple stats and grouping

```python
# Average bill length per species
clean_penguins.groupby("species")["bill_length_mm"].mean().round(2)
```

```python
# Average body mass by species & sex
clean_penguins.groupby(["species", "sex"])["body_mass_g"].mean().round(1).unstack()
```

### A quick plot (matplotlib)

```python
# Scatter: bill length vs. bill depth
ax = clean_penguins.plot.scatter(x="bill_length_mm", y="bill_depth_mm", title="Penguins: Bill Measurements")
plt.show()
```

```python
# Histogram of flipper lengths
ax = clean_penguins["flipper_length_mm"].plot.hist(bins=20, title="Penguins: Flipper Length Distribution")
plt.xlabel("flipper_length_mm")
plt.show()
```

### Compare between species

```python
# --------------------------------------------
# Bill length vs. depth with regression lines
# --------------------------------------------
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))

sns.lmplot(
    data=penguins,
    x="bill_length_mm",
    y="bill_depth_mm",
    hue="species",
    palette=["darkorange", "purple", "#008B8B"],  # fixed
    height=6, aspect=1.2
)
plt.title("Penguin bill dimensions with regression lines")
plt.show()
```

Your output plot should look something like this:

</Alert>

## Annotate your notebook

Jupyter notebooks are great for mixing code, results, and narrative text. This makes them ideal for sharing and reproducible research. You can add Markdown cells to explain your steps. 

Double-click a cell to edit it, then change its type to Markdown (++esc++ then ++m++).

<Alert severity="info" sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
  <AlertTitle>Here are some quick Markdown tips:</AlertTitle>
  - **Headings**: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
  - **Bold**: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
  - **Italics**: `*italics*` or `_italics_`
  - **Lists**: `- item` or `1. item`
  - **Links**: `[text](url)`
  - **Code**: `` `code` `` for inline, or triple backticks for blocks:
    ```python
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
    ```
</Alert>

You can also add images, LaTeX math, and more. See the [Jupyter Markdown Guide](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) for details.

## Save, restart, and export

* **Save**: File → Save Notebook (or ++ctrl+cmd+s++)
* **Restart Kernel**: Kernel → Restart Kernel (useful if things get “stuck”)
* **Shutdown**: In the **File Browser**, right-click the notebook → **Shut Down Kernel**. This will free up resources.
* **Export**: File → Save and Export Notebook As… (e.g., HTML)

## File persistence and best practices

* Your files typically persist across sessions in your home space on BadgerCompute.
  * Keep work organized in folders (`badgercompute_intro`, project1, etc.).
* Use Git for version control if you’re doing extended work:
  * Clone a repo in a Terminal: git clone `https://github.com/your/repo.git`
  * Commit regularly; push to GitHub for off-platform backup.

## Shut down and log out

* Close notebooks or shut down their kernels from the **Running Terminals and Kernels** panel (left sidebar → “Running” tab).
* From the top right of JupyterLab, click your user menu → **Log Out** (or return to the Hub control panel and choose **Stop My Server** if visible).
* You can safely close the browser tab.

## Forward - Where to go next

* Explore more notebooks in your repo or public tutorials.
* Try **pandas** joins/merges, groupby + aggregation, or **matplotlib/plotly** visualizations.
* Practice uploading your own CSV via the File Browser and running similar analyses.
