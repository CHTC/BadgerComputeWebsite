# Development


## Docker

This is the easiest, if you have something quick I would do this.

Run the command below and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

```shell
docker compose up
```

## PNPM

[Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and run `pnpm run dev`

This will be the fastest if you aren't on linux.

## Documentation 

Navigation for the docs can be found in /app/docs/navigation.ts

If you add a page it needs to be added here as well
