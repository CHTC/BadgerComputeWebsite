# BadgerHub

# Development


## Docker

This is the easiest, if you have something quick I would do this.

Run the command below and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

```shell
docker compose up
```

## PNPM

[Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and run `pnpm run dev`

This will be the fastest if you aren't on linux.

## Documentation 

Navigation for the docs can be found in `/app/docs/navigation.ts`.

The docs are found in `/docs/`, with their images found in `/public/docs/`.

Refer to the admin docs for a [guide on writing documentation](https://badgercompute.wisc.edu/docs/admin-docs/) in this repository. If you need a custom component reach out 
to the web staff.
